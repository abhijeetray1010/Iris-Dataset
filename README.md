# Iris-Dataset
## Iris-Flower-Dataset
Classify iris plants into three species i.e multi-class Classification
## Introduction
The Iris flower data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems. It is sometimes called Anderson's Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species.
## Purpose
The dataset contains a set of 150 records under 5 attributes - Petal Length, Petal Width, Sepal Length, Sepal width and Class(Species) Our ambitions is to perform multi-class classification i.e classify Iris flowers into 3 species namely Iris Setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor based on the length and width measurements of their sepals and petals.
I will be performing data analysis to find insights and then do predicitive modelling using various models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, SVM and Naive Bayes. I will demonstrate K-fold validation and Grid Search CV to find the best model. I will also cover Unsupervised learning here. The project makes use of NumPy, Pandas, scikit learn and Data Visualization Libraries.
## Dataset Description
In short, the dataset contains data for three species of a flower and we have four pieces of data for each flower (sepal length/width and petal length/width). Description of this dataset can be viewed on the Kaggle website, where the data was obtained (https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/iris#Iris.csv).
The columns in this dataset are:
Id, SepalLengthCm, SepalWidthCm, PetalLengthCm, PetalWidthCm, Species.
